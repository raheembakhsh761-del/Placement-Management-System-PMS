# 🚀 Namal Placement Management System (NPMS)

The **Namal Placement Management System (NPMS)** is a **Problem Based Learning (PBL)** project developed for the **Data Structures & Algorithms** course at **Namal University**, under the supervision of **Sir Farrukh Qureshi**.

This system provides a **centralized, web-based platform** to manage placement-related activities such as job postings, student records, and opportunity notifications using efficient **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Effective communication between placement offices and students is critical for sharing information about:

- Internships  
- Job opportunities  
- Exchange programs  
- Competitions  

**NPMS** solves this problem by offering a **single, organized portal** where verified opportunities are shared in real time.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Traditional placement management suffers from:

- Unorganized data  
- Multiple communication platforms  
- Lack of real-time updates  

**NPMS** addresses these challenges using **optimized data structures and algorithms** for fast data storage, retrieval, and processing.
